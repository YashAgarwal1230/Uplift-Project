Uplift Project

Topic - 'Service Center Management System'

Done this project using PYTHON,DATA SCIENCE and MySql.

Suppose we bought an Electronic item or product from market and product has 12 months guarantee period.
Now after 2 or 3 months your product is not working properly.So we call in the Service Center and they will send the technician from there.
So the Service Center records, created in service Center for the daily information is called Service Center Management System.

In this Project I have created a 'Service Center Homepage' consisting of various records like Service Center owner details, customer details, Product details, calldata details, Service type details etc

Our project will fully manage all the day-to-day records as in the Electronic service Center.

Anytime we can find or search the previous record, delete a record, update someone's record, reset the record, etc.

We can also Visualize the data in record by various charts such as bar, scatter, pie etc.
We have also Visualize the data using AutoViz.

The platform we have used is spyder and Jupyter.
